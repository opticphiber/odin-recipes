        <p style="line-height: 1.5;">Yakutia is the coldest inhabited place in the world, 
            so there aren't a lot of fresh vegetables, fruit, or anything else harvested 
            from the ground. Yakutian food is influenced by our cold climate, 
            where meat or fish is often eaten raw in a lightly frozen state and also, 
            Yakutian cuisine generally relies heavily on dairy products, meat, fish, 
            and foraged goods. Below you'll find the recipes of some of them
